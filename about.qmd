**Hello there!**

I'm a Data Scientist and Agile Coach currently working at [Novartis Biomedical Research](https://www.novartis.com/research-and-development) with a passion for using AI in my daily work. I take a data-driven approach, focusing on delivering innovative solutions with real-world impact. My expertise includes:

* **AI & Machine Learning:** Deep learning, explainable AI, and building production-ready ML models.

* **Team & Tech Leadership:** Fostering team growth and driving digital transformation. 

* **Pharmaceutical Industry:** Deep understanding of the drug development pipeline, from research to market.

Previously, I've worked at [Roche](https://www.roche.com/) tackling challenges across the entire drug development process. 

### Open Source Advocate

I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing.  I'm actively involved in the open-source community, contributing to make research tools more accessible and empower scientists worldwide.
