Welcome to my personal blog!

I thought it would be useful to start with an AI-generated image so here it is (looks familiar?).
In this blog, I'm going to write mostly about the stuff related to AI, computer science, and agile, or... well, everything that I find either useful, interesting, or enjoyable.

And as the late Terry Pratchett wrote in one of his books:

> It doesn't stop being magic just because you know how it works.
